#Working out to the Beeps v.0.0.1

This is a commandline program written to work out with at home or in a gym.  You are able to set # of sets or rounds, also set length of round or set (in seconds) as well as your rest time (in seconds).  It will be in different frequencies to let you know to work or rest and a really high pitch tone at the end of the program to let you know its over.  The program will print out in real-time the # of set you are on from the command-line, it will also give the total time at the end. 0:00:00.  I use it for a stablization work out I put together.

30/sec on 30/sec rest
30 sets total

Good program to start with.

1. Push-up position (do as many as you can, then just hold to the beep)
2. wall sqaut (chair)
3. fore arm on ground in prone position (similar to push up)
4. one arm form arm (obliques)
5. lung squat (both legs)
